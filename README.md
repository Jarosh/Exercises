There's nothing in here except some images for insertion into articles.

Whatever you may be interested in was composed as wiki pages - **https://github.com/Jarosh/Exercises/wiki**

There I'll collect miscellaneous programming problems, interview questions and whatever is used to test ones ability to think in general.

Happy reading ;)
